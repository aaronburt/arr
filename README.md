# Setup


* Create an `.env` file with the contents of `.env.sample`
* Next, amend the freshly created `.env` with variables appropriate for the environment
* Finally, run `docker compose up -d` 


# The Idea

It will inject the variables into the docker containers on runtime, this means you don't need to touch the compose file for most reasons
